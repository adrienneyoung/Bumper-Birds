#Bumper Birds 
by Laila Esa, Adrienne Yang, Orlando Diaz, Tiffany Lieu

Bumper Birds is a local two-player competitive game. The players play as a bird (either a chicken or a penguin) and their goal is to kill each other
by bumping each other into the spikes. There are several power-ups that appear on the screen to help the players battle. 
The power-ups include: egg shooting attack, dash attack, gain 1 life, and invincibility for 1 hit. Whoever wins 2 of 3 rounds is the winner.
